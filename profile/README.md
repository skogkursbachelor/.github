# Lumber Transport 🌲 Development of new tools for varying weather and road conditions 🛣️

Changes in climate have extended the snow-free season, increasing variability of forestry road conditions due to alternating periods of freezing, drying, and rainfall. Skogkurs recognized the need for a digital tool to assess and forecast road trafficability. This [thesis](https://github.com/skogkursbachelor/thesis) presents a **prototype system for fully digital modeling of forestry road load-bearing capacity under varying conditions throughout the year**. The system is implemented as a web application that visualizes trafficability of Norwegian forestry roads based on environmental factors such as soil moisture, frost depth, and superficial deposits. The solution classifies road conditions using a **traffic-light model** and integrates geospatial and meteorological data to display both current and forecast trafficability up to nine days ahead. The system consists of a [backend](https://github.com/skogkursbachelor/server) with a RESTful API and a [frontend](https://github.com/skogkursbachelor/website) built with OpenLayers for **map-based visualization**. Stakeholder feedback confirms the prototype's feasibility and effectiveness as a foundation for a future operational system in the forestry industry.
